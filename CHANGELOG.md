## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Keyed automations with a `trigger_type` discriminator (`issue`, `pull_request`,
  `cron`) sharing one discovery, scheduling, and execution pipeline.
- Native provider adapters for OpenCode, Codex, Claude Code, and Cursor with
  optional `model`/`effort`/`agent` translation and explicit permission options.
- Bounded async process runner with disconnected stdin, output limits, timeouts,
  and process-group cleanup.
- Non-destructive SQLite state: incompatible files raise instead of being deleted.
- `validate`, `run` (with `--dry-run`), and `watch` commands with documented exit
  codes.

### Changed

- Configuration moved to `settings` plus `coding_agents` with global polling and
  per-automation prompts; the map key is the automation ID.
- Custom-agent names are only accepted where a verified native flag exists
  (`--agent` for OpenCode and Claude Code).
